        as Duel, Capture The Flag, Dungeons and Arenas.

        Starting off this best mobile FPS games 2021 list is also one of the
        newest games on it: PUBG New State. The latest in the PUBG series, New
        State is seemingly a sequel to the original PUBG and PUBG Mobile. Taking
        place decades after the events of PUBG, this is meant to be the future
        of PUBG.PUBG New State is by no means a bad game, or else it would not
        be on this list, but it is a strange one, for sure. In many ways, it
        does feel just like it is copying itself and what was done with PUBG
        Mobile, but with some minor UI changes, plus the brand new map of
        Troi.Troi is an alright map in PUBG New State, but one that is not as
        futuristic as hoped. That said, this is the latest PUBG game and, while
        the content is lacking right now, there is a strong chance that it will
        take the place of PUBG Mobile someday, so it might be worth jumping on
        board early with this very familiar but still interesting and fun battle
        royale title.

        Going from one end of the spectrum to the other, we have one of the
        oldest games on this list: Dead Trigger 2. I remember downloading this
        game years ago as the showstopper that I would use to test out new
        Android phones that I was reviewing at the time.Little did I know that
        this story-based zombie adventure that pushed the envelope for graphics
        on mobile at the time would still be going strong in 2021. But that is
        the case and Dead Trigger 2 benefits from a great community and
        developers who support this game well.There is a reason that Dead
        Trigger 2 is still going strong today as it is the Left 4 Dead-like
        experience with many different regions, customization, and content to
        enjoy. Until Dead Trigger 3 someday comes out, hopefully, this is going
        to be one of the best zombie experiences you can find on mobile.

        There are a lot of comparisons of Infinity Ops to Call of Duty Mobile,
        and for good reason. Set far into the future, this is a game that is
        filled with mechs and various classes that define the fast-paced and
        jetpack-centric gameplay. In many ways, it is also like the Titanfall
        series but for mobile.The game is pretty to look at, with nice sci-fi
        environments to explore and fun gunplay that helps to keep it engaging.
        The multiplayer is good, even though the game modes and maps are a bit
        lacking at this time. Hopefully, in the future, there will be more
        options for players to check out.That said, Infinity Ops is a great
        choice for the Infinite Warfare and Black Ops 3 fans out there who
        prefer a more floaty gameplay experience compared to the grounded nature
        of Call of Duty Mobile, or just want to try something different on the
        multiplayer side.

        Moving away from the multiplayer-focused games for a bit, we have
        Hitman: Sniper, the quintessential Hitman experience on mobile. This
        spin-off of the assassin console and PC series takes Agent 47 to mobile
        by focusing his missions on being a sniper elite only.There are plenty
        of missions, areas, and customization that you can enjoy throughout the
        progression of the game as you attempt to take down your targets. As it
        is mentioned in the name, this is focused on sniping only, so you will
        not have some of the staples of the series.That said, the sniper
        elements are fantastic and nicely thought out, creating a strategic
        experience that feels uniquely built for mobile without sacrificing the
        fun of the Hitman series in general. Hitman fans who like mobile games
        should definitely not pass up on this fascinating spin-off title.

        A common thread that you will find when looking up most of the games on
        this list is the fact that they will require an internet connection at
        all times, or at least most of the time, in order to play them. But what
        if you are someone who wants an offline mobile shooter and/or FPS game
        that is worth playing?That is when I always recommend Nova Legacy, the
        latest in the Nova series that defined almost console-like gameplay on
        mobile while looking visually great at the same time. The fight against
        the aliens continues in this title with a full-on story campaign and
        plenty of other side content to do.And if you do happen to have internet
        access for the game, you will be able to benefit from even more content,
        like the online multiplayer. You can take the skills that you have honed
        in the singleplayer story and apply them to the possibly more
        challenging battles against real players.

        When it comes to visually stunning shooters on mobile, there is no
        reason to look any further than Dead Effect 2. The beautiful space
        adventure is equally horrifying as much as it is appealing to the eyes.
        The dark and gory FPS game is a different style from just about every
        other game on this list.With some definitely horror-like elements to it,
        Dead Effect 2 is a FPS take on what seems to be inspired by the
        third-person Dead Space series, right down to the setting, name, style,
        and slice and dice of enemies. With a surprisingly long story campaign
        and tons of content to enjoy, Dead Effect 2 is one for a console-like
        campaign that does not hold back.Though there are some issues in the
        game with grinding against bosses and the like for customization, the
        RPG features in Dead Effect 2 do help to add to the length and value of
        the experience. It is free-to-play, too, but with the usual
        microtransactions, some of which are more unfortunate than in other
        games.

        What can be said about Fortnite than has already been said in the
        numerous other lists that it has been included in, like the best battle
        royale games of 2021? Fortnite took the world by storm when it first
        released and it only continued to dominate on mobile devices.Though the
        lawsuit issues with Apple and Google caused it to be taken off of the
        App Store and Google Play Store, respectively, it is still available for
        Android users at this time. Sorry, iOS fans who cannot play it, but
        there really is no battle royale game like Fortnite.A celebration of all
        things pop culture, with people like Ariana Grande fighting alongside
        fictional characters like Naruto, there is no battle royale like this
        one. Add in user-created content and there is so much that you can do in
        Fortnite that will keep you busy for ages to come.

        While Fortnite is a fantastic game, it is, admittedly, one that does not
        put the gunplay and shooter elements of the battle royale experience
        first and foremost. On the other hand, PUBG Mobile is not only the game
        that popularized the genre, but one that is grounded in strong shooter
        gameplay. Able to be played in both first-person or third-person, PUBG
        Mobile is a competent mobile port of the original PC game that stands on
        its own right and has arguably surpassed its predecessor. With plenty of
        quality battle royale maps and other game modes, there is s a lot to
        love about this game.PUBG Mobile is also one of the grittier, more
        grounded takes on a mobile shooter that takes itself quite seriously. If
        you’re looking for an experience that has grown considerably over the
        last couple of years into a jam-packed, highly enjoyable mobile title,
        this might be the one for you.

        Final Fantasy 7 The First SoldierAll of these elements are smartly built
        into the game, not feeling like shoe-horned attempts to make this
        related to the Final Fantasy series. The icing on the cake is the fact
        that it is also one of the best-looking and performing mobile games
        around, doing the Final Fantasy name justice. The only thing holding it
        back from first for now is that it is still new and, therefore, not
        having as much content as the next game on this list.
